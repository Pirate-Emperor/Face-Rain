# Face-Rain

Developed by Pirate-Emperor, Face-Rain is an intriguing project focused on creating a pixel animation of facial expressions "raining" down the screen.
- It is a simple web-based animation made for the purpose of getting in touch with JS.
- In this project, we are recreating a face from the pixels in the form of rainfall.
## Features

- **Facial Pixel Art**: Crafted pixel art for various facial expressions, capturing emotions such as happiness, sadness, surprise, and more.
- **Dynamic Animation**: Implemented animation logic to make faces rain down from the top of the screen with varying speeds and trajectories.
- **Randomization**: Faces are randomly selected with random starting positions, speeds, and rotation angles to create a lively animation.
- **Interactive Controls**: Users can adjust the frequency of the faces, their speed, and even the types of faces displayed.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Developed an easy-to-use interface with start, stop, and reset buttons to control the animation.

## Prerequisites

## Usage

Open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You should see facial expressions "raining" down the screen. You can interact with the controls on the page to adjust the animation settings.

## Data Source

The project uses pixel art assets for various facial expressions. You can add or replace these assets to customize the faces used in the animation.

## Development

To enhance the project, you can modify the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in the `src` directory. Some potential areas for improvement include:

- Adding more facial expression pixel art for variety.
- Introducing different animation effects, such as bouncing or fading faces.
